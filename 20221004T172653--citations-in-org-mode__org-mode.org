The car of =org-cite-export-processors= elements defines the back-end that org-citations take when being exported. Has values of =basic, csl, bibtex=. =bibtex= uses the biblatex package for latex, while =csl= uses the general Citation Style Language, which can also be used by latex.

CSL emits plain-text into html/latex/etc., so links and citation numbering cannot be handled. Biblatex seems more flexible in that regard.
