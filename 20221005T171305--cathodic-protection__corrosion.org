A method to control electrochemical corrosion of a metal part. Utilizes the [[denote:20221005T171546][Galvanic Series]], where the sacrificial anode has a more negative reduction potential than the desired part. The anode will be attached by the electrolytic environment, and will have to be replaced.

The system can have a bias voltage to ensure proper function.
