- Boosting signals of rare/corner cases
- Can focus on specific behaviors
  - Test for associated breakage
  - Understand small but important interactions
- When working with personal information
  - Also when data has security liabilities and is locked down
- Need to show that process works before using real data
  - Both with sensitive data, and with large projects that are being built
- Model any "what if" scenarios

* Importance of Simulating Data
- In general, simulate from a model, then refit to see any differences
- Determine if a model can recover effects reliably/unbiasedly
  - Simulate with known parameters, then fit model to see estimation quality
- Check power of model for various scenarios
- Can check predictive performance of a model
- Can check Data-Generation Processes that do not satisfy all assumptions of a model
