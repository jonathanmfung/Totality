Case of a [[denote:20221004T171624][Statistical Bias]] where a (potentially hidden) variable is affected by other variables, which are the main focus of the analysis.

In [[denote:20221004T171714][Causal Inference]], stratifying on the collider variable may reveal phantom association between the other variables, this is not desirable.
