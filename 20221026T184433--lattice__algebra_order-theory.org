* Order Theory Definition
A paritally ordered set that is both a join- and meet-semilattice

A join-semilattice is a partially ordered set that has a binary relation /join/ (least upper bound, aka supremum) where \(\forall x,y \in S: \exists \sup(\{x,y\})\). Likewise for a meet-semilattice and greatest lower bound, aka infinum.

A join-semilattice is /bounded/ if it has a least element, defined as the join of the empty set. Likewise for a meet-semilattice and a greatest element. This element can be thought of as a sort of [[denote:20221026T192959][bottom]].

* Algebra Definition
An algebraic structure of set \(L\) with two binary, commutative, and associative operations that satisfy the following for all \(a,b \in L\):

\(a \lor (a \land b) = a\)

\(a \land (a \lor b) = a\)

The two types of semilattices are then defined as \((L, \lor)\) and \((L, \land)\), for join- and meet-.
