A case of a Statistical Model that contains both [[denote:20221004T172001][Fixed Effects Model]] and [[denote:20221004T172239][Random Effects Model]].

Useful for repeated measurements and when observations are clustered.

Case of Repeated: Repeated measures on same subjects, but number of measurements is not the same across the subjects. Then the measurements are clustered inside subjects.

Case of clustered: Looking at a school, with students in same classes/teacher. Each class would have a random slope.

* Math
\(\vec{y} = X \vec{\beta} + Z \vec{u} + \vec{\epsilon}\)

- \(\vec{\beta}\) is fixed
- \(\vec{u}, \vec{\epsilon}\) are random
- \(X, Z\) are design matrices
